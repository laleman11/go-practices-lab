# 🧪 go-practices-lab

> A personal repository of Go (Golang) exercises, data structures, design patterns, and real-world mini projects. This lab is focused on deepening core backend skills, exploring idiomatic Go practices, and preparing for technical challenges and interviews.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This project is structured as a modular collection of practical Go code, covering:

- 🔁 **Classic Algorithms**: sorting, searching, recursion
- 🧱 **Data Structures**: stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, maps
- 🧵 **Concurrency**: goroutines, channels, `sync`, `context`, worker pools
- 🧩 **Design Patterns**: implemented idiomatically in Go
- 🧪 **Testing Practices**: unit tests, table-driven tests, mocks (`sqlmock`, `httptest`)
- 🛠 **Real-world Projects**: CLI tools, REST APIs, utilities, benchmarks
